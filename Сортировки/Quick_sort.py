Быстрая сортировка
QuickSort is a divide and conquer algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the
picked pivot.

There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways.

Always pick the first element as a pivot
Always pick the last element as a pivot
Pick a random element as a pivot
Pick median as a pivot
Here we will be picking the last element as a pivot. The key process in quickSort is partition(). Target of partitions
is, given an array and an element ‘x’ of array as a pivot, put x at its correct position in a sorted array and put all
smaller elements (smaller than x) before x, and put all greater elements (greater than x) after x. All this should be
done in linear time.

# Python program for implementation of Quicksort Sort

# This implementation utilizes pivot as the last element in the nums list
# It has a pointer to keep track of the elements smaller than the pivot
# At the very end of partition() function, the pointer is swapped with the pivot
# to come up with a "sorted" nums relative to the pivot


# Function to find the partition position
def partition(array, low, high):

    # choose the rightmost element as pivot
    pivot = array[high]

    # pointer for greater element
    i = low - 1

    # traverse through all elements
    # compare each element with pivot
    for j in range(low, high):
        if array[j] <= pivot:

            # If element smaller than pivot is found
            # swap it with the greater element pointed by i
            i = i + 1

            # Swapping element at i with element at j
            (array[i], array[j]) = (array[j], array[i])

    # Swap the pivot element with the greater element specified by i
    (array[i + 1], array[high]) = (array[high], array[i + 1])

    # Return the position from where partition is done
    return i + 1

# function to perform quicksort
