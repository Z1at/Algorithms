Backtracking is

Imagine that we're walking along a path.

Then, we reach a fork. We pick one of the paths, and walk.

Then, we reach another fork in the path. We pick one of the paths again, and go on walking, then we reach a dead end. So, we backtrack to the last point we had a fork, then go through the other path that we didn't choose the first time.

Then we reach another dead end. So, we backtrack once more and realize that there are no other paths we can go from there. So we backtrack again, and explore the other path we didn't choose the first time we came to this point.

We reach yet another dead end, so we backtrack. We see that there are no more paths to explore, so we backtrack once more.

Now, we're at our starting point. There are no more paths left to explore, so we can stop walking.
